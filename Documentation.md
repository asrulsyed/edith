# Gaurika - The User Guide

## Introduction

Gaurika is an open-source project designed to allow users to plug in their own API keys and a base URL compatible with the OpenAI SDK. However, for the time being, you can use Gaurika for free without any requirements, powered by the llama3.1-70b model provided by Cerebras.

> In short, you can use Gaurika for free right now, but if you prefer, you can use your own API keys and base URL.
