# Gaurika - The User Guide

## Introduction
Gaurika is an open source project that was built mainly to allow users to plug their own api keys and a base url compatible with the openai sdk and use it, but for the time being I am able to offer a free llm, the llama3.1-70b provided by Cerebras.

> In short you can for the time being use Gaurika for free without any requirements, however if you're aware enough, you can plug your own api keys and base url and use it.
